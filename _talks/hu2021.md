Keynote talk at the 3rd annual Hutch United Symposium.

I first talk about model-agnostic measures of variable importance.

I also discuss some of my work towards making biomedical research and practice more equitable, diverse, and inclusive. I will highlight a recently-created virtual internship program between Fred Hutch and the Seattle Central MESA (Mathematics, Engineering, and Science Achievement) program.
